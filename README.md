## This repository holds the code and data as part of analysis done on an Opticals shop details are hidden. 

#### The main aim of this analysis is to give some insights to the trend about the data of the Optical shop. The data provided by the shop as part of the project is given of the Month January 2023.

The ipnyb file consists of all the code for the analysis <br>
The OPTICALS.xlsx file contains the raw data directly obtained from the owner of the shop. The csv file is extracted from the xlsx file and cleaned to finally get the cleaned csv file.<br>
<h3>Project Details</h3>
<h4>Problem Statement</h4><p>The difficulties an optical store faces in effectively predicting customer demand for its products and setting fair prices are the focus of this project. We will create a demand forecasting and pricing prediction model that takes into account many aspects that affect demand, such as seasonality and trends, using past sales data as well as external market data. Utilizing machine learning methods, the model will be evaluated and improved. The optical business will be able to better predict demand and set pricing that reflect market conditions by using this model, which will lead to improved inventory management and more prospects for sales. The data is gathered using the procedures specified, and the analysis tools described shall be used in accordance with the plotting and prediction methodologies described. This data is utilised to train the model, which will be used to estimate demand and predict sales in the future. According to the textiles indicated in this proposal, the project delivery timetable is spread out over the upcoming few months.</p>
